🌐 This repository contains my personal web developer portfolio created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to showcase my web development skills and projects in a professional and accessible way.

📱 The portfolio features a fully responsive design, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

✨ Key sections include:

🧑💻 About Me: A brief introduction about myself, my background, and my passion for web development.

💡 Skills: A list of technical skills and technologies I am proficient in, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), responsive design techniques, and basic accessibility principles.

📂 Projects: Showcases of my web development projects where each project has a description, technologies used, screenshots, and links to live demos and source code repositories.

📬 Contact: A simple contact form built using HTML and JavaScript for visitors to reach out to me directly.

🎨 In building this portfolio, I focused on clean and semantic HTML structure, applying CSS for a modern and visually appealing design, and using JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic content.

🚀 This project demonstrates my ability to create a complete, professional web presence, combining design and functionality to highlight my capabilities as a web developer.
